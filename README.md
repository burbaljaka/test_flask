# test_flask

Simple flask app, created in terms of learning the framework

To start a project please process with:

 - git clone https://github.com/burbaljaka/test_flask.git
 - cd test_flask
 - make sure you have created and activated virtualenv
 - pip install -r requirements.txt
 - open python command prompt
 
 I've attached existing db to simplify demonstration. In case you'd like to use your own db please delete file 'database.db'
 and then from python command prompt do this:
 - db.create_all() 
 - exit()
 - python app.py
 
 That is enough to launch this project
